* PriceToEarnings  = (MarketPrice) / (Earnings Per Share)
* BookValue        = (ShareHolder Equity - Intangibles)
* PriceToBook      = (Common Stock Price) / (BookValue per Share)
* PegRatio         = (P/E) / (Annual EPS Growth)
* PriceToSalesRt   = (Common Stock Price) / (NetSales / CommonSharesOutstanding)
